# Double Dominoes

## Game Rules
Double Dominoes - also known as Mexican Train - is like dominoes with a few added rules. Firstly the numbers go up to twelve. Each player has their own "Train" where they can play their tiles. The game is started with the double 12 in the middle. Players take turns building their trains, if they can't play their train is "Opened" meaning other players can play on their train. If a player plays on their own "Open" train it is closed again and only they can play on it. Additionally there is a "Sauce" train which is always open and anyone can play on. If a player can't play on their own train but can play on another train their train remains closed. Lastly if a double ("Gate") is played (eg. 11-11 on a 8-11) then play can only resume once another tile has been played on the double (eg. 11-6 on the 11-11), players take turns trying to play on the double and can't play on any other trains until the "Gate" is opened, the person who played the double is the first person who needs to attempt to open it, if a player cannot open the gate they must pick up. Round ends when a player has finished their tiles or no one can play and there are no more tiles to pick up. A players score per round is the sum of numbers on their left over tiles, play continues until a player hits 100, then whoever has the lowest score wins.

## The AI
- The AI_1_v2 plays randomly. I did this to create a benchmark to compare with.

## Notes
- I decided to use numpy instead of lists to store tiles. The difference in speed is probably negligable and lists would've been a lot simpler but I wanted to try and get familiar with the library. I only later discovered that numpy is very slow when appending things to an array as it creates a new copy everytime. Lists is also a lot easier to index tiles as a list of tuples can be used, which is what I decided to use in version 2 when making the AI. The idea behind version 2 was to compare the AIs and use lists instead of numpy arrays.
